# self-driving-cars
This is a software for self-driving cars (based on CARLA Simulator).
- Course1FinalProject: Implement longitudinal and lateral controllers to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints where the vehicle needs to reach at certain desired speeds.
  - Waypoints: "racetrack_waypoints.txt" file
  - Controllers: "controller2d.py" file
    - Longitudinal Controller: PID controller outputting vehicle throttle and brake (in percentage)
    - Lateral Controller: Stanley controller outputting vehicle steering (in radians)
