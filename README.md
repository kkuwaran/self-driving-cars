# self-driving-cars
This is a software for self-driving cars (based on CARLA Simulator).
- Course1FinalProject: Implement longitudinal and lateral controllers to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints where the vehicle needs to reach at certain desired speeds.
  - Waypoints: "racetrack_waypoints.txt" file
  - Controllers: "controller2d.py" file
    - Longitudinal Controller: PID controller outputting vehicle throttle and brake (in percentage)
    - Lateral Controller: Stanley controller outputting vehicle steering (in radians)
- Course2FinalProject: Implement the Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) to localize a vehicle using data from the CARLA simulator. The filter relies on IMU data to propagate the state forward in time, and GPS and LIDAR position updates to correct the state estimate.
  - ES-EKF Implementation: "es_ekf.py" file
  - Helping Functions: "rotations.py" file
- Course3Assignment: Implement visual odometry to estimate an autonomous vehicle trajectory by images taken with a monocular camera set up on the vehicle: Extract features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle, Use the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs, Use the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs, Use the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory
  - Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving: "Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving.ipynb" file
  - DatasetHandler (class): "m2bk.py" file
  - RGB images and Depth frames: "data" folder
- Course3FinalProject: Implement a baseline environmental perception stack to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment: Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D, Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation, Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors, Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car
  - Environment Perception For Self-Driving Cars: "Environment Perception For Self-Driving Cars - Learner - v1.ipynb" file
  - DatasetHandler (class), compute_plane (function), dist_to_plane (function), get_slope_intecept (function), extrapolate_lines (function), find_closest_lines (function): "m6bk.py" file
  - Depth images, RGB images, Segmentation images: "data" folder
  - Output: "images" folder 
- Course4FinalProject: Implement a functional motion planning stack that can avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while tracking the center line of a lane, while also handling stop signs. This includes behavioral planning logic, path generation, static collision checking, path selection, and velocity profile generation
  - Behaviour Planning Logic: "behavioural_planner.py" file contains the behavioural logic required to handle a stop sign, i.e., a state machine that transitions between lane following, deceleration to the stop sign, staying stopped, and back to lane following, when it encounters a stop sign
  - Path Generation: "local_planner.py" and "path_optimizer.py" files compute the goal state set (the set of goal points to plan paths to before path selection), compute the yaw of the car at a set of arc length points for a given spiral, set up the optimization problem for a given path, and generate the path from the resulting spiral once the optimization is complete
  - Static Collision Checking: "collision_checker.py" file contains circle-based collision checking on the computed path set
  - Path Selection: "collision_checker.py" file evaluates an objective function over the generated path set to select the best path, i.e., it eliminates paths that are in collision with static obstacles, and selects paths that both track the centerline of the global path
  - Velocity Profile Generation: "velocity_planner.py" file generates velocity profile that can handle stop signs, lead dynamic obstacles, as well as nominal lane maintenance
